## NullPointer

This is a markdown-based blog system using Next.js

It contains four main modules: 
+ Internal and external authentication
  (The external authentication is currently down for the reason I haven't known yet. It works fine in development, but has bug in production)
+ A markdown editor with a file system tree
+ A forum where users can share, like, bookmark notes, etc.
+ Profile page
